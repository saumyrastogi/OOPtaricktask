Created a main div with class sp , it contains two divs displayed in inline-block , one contains the left content and the other contains form .
Customized its appearance using CSS , in the left div content is displayed as ordered list , right div contains the form containing required validator for every field. 
If the user enters data in correct format and the password matches correctly , user's data is displayed , else an alert appears that tell password in not matched .
Added the functionality using JS and DOM , as the click event is triggered new paragraph tags are created using createElement prop which is appended in a newly created div that in turn is appended in the main div. After one click , submit button is disabled so that details are displayed only once.
